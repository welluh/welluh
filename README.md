**frontend / fullstack / lead developer, freelancer and accessibility enthusiast**

I've been working as a frontend developer nearly a decade.
I started with small-scale projects with Joomla, Wordpress, Typo3 and 
good ol' HTML+CSS+JS as a freelance web developer.
Back in September 2013 I decided to make a career out of my side hustle.
