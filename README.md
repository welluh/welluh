## Wellu Hietala

**Agile, hyperautomation email template manager.**

Pending promises and working as a web developer for nearly a decade.

I started with small-scale projects with Joomla, Wordpress, Typo3 and 
good ol' HTML+CSS+JS as a freelance web developer.
Back in September 2013 I decided to make a career out of my side hustle.
