## Wellu Hietala

**Principal Consultant**

Moikkuli! 
I'm Wellu, a full-stack developer and accessibility specialist with a knack for UI/UX development, design systems, and rapid prototyping. With over a decade of experience across various industries, I've transitioned from a culinary career to hand crafting exceptional digital services.

I'm always eager to learn new skills and technologies, which is why I occasionally take on freelance projects to keep myself on my toes. When I'm not yelling at my own code (we've all been there, right?), I am mentoring other developers, helping them level up their skills and grow in their careers.
